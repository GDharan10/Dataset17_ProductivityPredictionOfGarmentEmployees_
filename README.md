# Productivity Prediction of Garment Employees

## Introduction
The Garment Industry is a significant example of industrial globalization in the modern era. This dataset provides important attributes related to the garment manufacturing process and the productivity of employees, which have been collected and validated by industry experts. 

## Context
The dataset includes various attributes such as date, day of the week, department, team number, number of workers, number of style changes, targeted productivity, standard minute value (SMV), work in progress (WIP), overtime, incentive, idle time, idle men, and actual productivity. These attributes are crucial for analyzing and predicting the productivity performance of working teams in garment manufacturing companies.
